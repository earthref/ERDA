# ERDA
The EarthRef.org Digital Archive (ERDA). The EarthRef Digital Archive contains any type of digital data object associated with the Earth sciences. Data objects may be part of non-published Earth Sciences projects ranging from data tables to diagrams to reports to geological maps to videos. Users may make contributions to the database, which may then be viewed and downloaded.

This repository currently has no code. This will be added in the future when ERDA is moved over to the Meteor web platform. We are using this repository to track issues with the current ERDA website.
